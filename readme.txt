My starter theme based on Underscores. I tweak it pretty much every time I build a site and find a new way to improve it.

I prefix everything with xthemex because I run my underscores-jumpstart.sh setup script at https://github.com/davidrgreen/wpdev-jumpstart-script in order to complete the setup.

## To Do
* Add links for choosing between post categories.
* Add menu in <noscript> with "showonmobile" class so if JavaScript is disabled people can still access the menu.
